# Kazi Zainab Khanam . Jarvis Consulting

  I have completed my master's degree in computer science, at Lakehead University, focusing on applied 
  machine learning and deep learning techniques to overcome numerous shortcomings in the health 
  domain. I have also worked as a Data Research Analyst in the DaTAlab research group of Lakehead University. My 
  research work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Govt. of 
  Canada. My research projects are published in reputed conferences and journals. The projects involved 
  analyzing a variety of large health data to find trends, anomalies, and other patterns in the data. 
  I am highly enthusiastic to develop data modeling products and provide solutions for different 
  types of datasets to optimize and ease decision-making processes that can save a substantial amount of 
  money and improve customer experience.

## Highlighted Projects
**Identifying health related occupations of Twitter Users through word embedding and deep neural networks**: Successfully used machine learning, data mining and statistical techniques to design predictive models for a classification problem e.g. identifying the occupations of users from their Twitter biographical contents. My project has been accepted in a reputed conference.

**Using Twitter for diabetes community analysis**: Designed a predictive model for detecting diabetic patients in Twitter from the tweets posted by users. In this project, the current use of trending hash-tags was examined, and the frequency of diabetes-related tweets was analyzed. Used Tableau database software for data cleaning and visualization as it processes data faster due to better indexing over other software options. Project has been published in a reputed journal and has been cited as well. [Link](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KaziZainab)

**The Homophily Principle in Social Network Analysis**:  Reviewed and surveyed the effect of homophily in social networks and summarized the state of art methods that has been proposed in the past years to identify and measure the effect of homophily. The project has been submitted in a reputed journal and the arXiv paper has been cited as well. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10383)
 
**Finding suitable locations for live campaigns using different machine learning techniques**:  Designed a recommender system of finding the suitable places for solving business problems of live campaigning using different Machine Learning algorithms based on spatio-temporal features of my preprocessed data-set.
